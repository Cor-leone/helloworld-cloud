# Grunt

This template uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), the Javascript Task Runner. To use Grunt with this Template App, do the following:

* Install grunt: ```npm install -g grunt-cli```
* In your App directory, run: ```npm install```. This installs Grunt plugins, etc for use with this App.
* Run ```grunt serve``` to server this App locally. By default this App will run on http://localhost:8001.

Note that 'grunt:server' supports live reload, i.e. it will monitor for any changes in your node.js application and automatically restart the server
